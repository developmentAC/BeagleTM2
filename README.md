## Overview

BeagleTM is an interactive text mining tool to facilitate discovery of knowledge in [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) peer-reviewed articles. In addition to locating the articles according to their abstracts, BeagleTM also connects articles based by the common language between them. The results of BeagleTM are connected networks which could be used as a starting place for a literature review at the beginning of the project.


BeagleTM Named after my puppy Beagle, Flint, who spends all his time rooting all around with his nose to the ground. By an exhaustive study of seemingly all words of the abstracts of articles, connections and discoveroies can be made between references.


BeagleTM has been designed to discover knowledge in PubMed articles and supporting references for the convenient creation of sophisticated literature reviews. The data for BeagleTM comes from curated article data made available from PubMed's [ftp site at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_bulk/](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_bulk/).

Text mining article information with BeagleTM involves two steps: _Parsing_ and _Analyzing_. During _parsing_, abstracts from the corpus documents are checked for their keyword content. Results are saved in an output document which undergo _analysis_ to find relationship networks (i.e., the interconnections between the knowledge of articles according to keyword content). These inter-relationships concern common themes of studies, articles of similar keywords, articles which are connected by common references and other types of bridges that serve to combine the intricate facts of knowledge areas.


### Relationship Networks

A relationship network displays the connected information as obtained with keywords. The network includes the main articles for which the keywords are relevant, and their supporting references in which the keywords are likely to be relevant. Networks are written in `html` files and are to be opened in a browser, shown in Figure 1, each node of a network is labeled with PubMedâ€™s PMID identifier number that serves to hyperlink nodes to articles at PubMed.

There are two types of nodes available in the networks: red and blue, for main and supporting reference articles, respectively. We note that the keywords are present in abstracts of main articles (red nodes), whereas they are not necessarily a part of supporting documents (blue nodes).

![A body of connected knowledge, File: connected.png](graphics/connected.png)
Figure 1: The articles relating to keywords create a body of knowledge. Main articles (red nodes, found by keyword content) are connected to their reference (blue nodes) articles. In networks, we are able to visualize which blue nodes serve as bridges for more than one red node to suggest that these references may be important bridges between works.


Shown in Figure 2, a mouse-over action of each node shows some metadata behind the nodes. In the case of red nodes (main articles), a title may be displayed which also serves as a link to the article at PubMed. In the case of blue nodes (reference articles), only a link to the article at PubMed may be obtained; the title information was not available during the text-mining process of the articles.


![Titles may be found in the networks, File mouseOver.png](graphics/mouseOver.png)
Figure 2: A screenshot of the red (main articles) and blue (supporting references). A mouse-over gives a title and link for red nodes and only a link for blue nodes.

Heatmaps are also available in which articles may be discovered according to their counts of supplied keywords, as shown in Figure 3.


## Command Summary

There are two main functions of the software.

* Client: Parser or Browser
    + Parser: App for searching for keywords in articles. Note: you must include a keyword file.
    + Browser: App to visualize data after parsing job.


Below are commands to run BeagleTM using a Docker container which houses all necessary libraries and software for BeagleTM.


* Get help to run the program
```
poetry run beagletm2 --bighelp
```

* Execute, process abstracts only

    ```
    poetry run beagletm2 --client parser --data-file kw_short.md --abs-only
    ```

* Execute, process abstracts only and create db from results.
    ```
    poetry run beagletm2 --client parser --data-file kw_short.md --make-db --abs-only
    ```

* Execute, process whole articles.
    ```
    poetry run beagletm2 --client parser --data-file kw_short.md --no-abs-only
    ```

* Execute, process whole articles and create db from results of smaller size. (Most commonly used ðŸ˜ƒ)
    ```
    poetry run beagletm2 --client parser --data-file kw_short.md --make-db --no-abs-only --save-less
    ```

## Run a series of tasks

If you want to run several different jobs using the same corpus, create a batch file (unix) with the code shown below.

File: __command.sh__

```
mkdir log
mkdir 0_out
poetry run beagletm2 --client parser --data-file kw_genPurposeEthics.md --make-db --no-abs-only --save-less  1>log/1_gen.md 2>log/2_gen.md &
poetry run beagletm2 --client parser --data-file kwClimateChange_i.md --make-db --no-abs-only --save-less 1>log/1_climate.md 2>log/2_climate.md &
```

To run the file using a unix OS, use the following command.

```
sh command.sh
```

## A work in progress

Check back often to see the evolution of the project!! BeagleTM is a work-in-progress. Updates to the methods and tests for the code will come soon and I will continue to update the repository with updates. If you would like to contribute to this project, __then please do!__ For instance, if you see some low-hanging fruit or task that you could easily complete, that could add value to the project, then I would love to have your insight.

Otherwise, please create an Issue for bugs or errors. Since I am a teaching faculty member at Allegheny College, I may not have all the time necessary to quickly fix the bugs and so I would be very happy to have any help that I can get from the OpenSource community for any technological insight. Much thanks in advance. I hope that this project helps you find the knowledge from PubMed that you require for your project. :-)
